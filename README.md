# Learning Web Application

This is a web-based learning application designed to enhance effective learning using the SuperMemo 2.0 algorithm. The app is built with Java and Spring Boot on the backend, and plain JavaScript along with Bootstrap for the frontend. The MySQL database is hosted on Google Cloud, and the application is deployed on Google Cloud App Engine.

## Key Features
- **User Registration & Activation**: 
  - Users can create accounts, receive an email with an activation link, and activate their account through the provided link.
  
- **Password Reset**: 
  - Allows users to reset their passwords through an email-based verification system.

- **Custom Flashcard Sets**:
  - Users can create their own flashcard sets, including adding images to their flashcards and listen to them for better learning experiences.
  
- **Learning Games**:
  - The app provides three engaging games to help with learning:
    - Flashcards
    - Quiz
    - Matching pairs
  
- **Search and Suggest Sets**: 
  - Users can search for flashcard sets created by others using keywords, and the app suggests sets based on the userâ€™s existing ones.

## Security
- **Spring Security**:
  - Implemented Spring Security to ensure secure user authentication and authorization.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: 
  - Java, Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), Plain JavaScript
- **Database**: 
  - MySQL (hosted on Google Cloud)
- **Deployment**: 
  - Google Cloud App Engine

This project demonstrates how effective learning techniques, such as spaced repetition (via the SuperMemo 2.0 algorithm), can be integrated into a modern web application.
